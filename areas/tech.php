<h4>Tech Transfer</h4>
Due to its geographical location, UTEP has been involved in a number of technology transfer activities with Central and South American countries.&nbsp; A technology transfer sub-center for Spanish-Speaking audiences was located at UTEP.&nbsp; The sub-center is currently the repository of technical reports and training videotapes, and has channels of communication to request any transportation-related information.<br/><br/>
                Several faculty and staff from UTEP have participated in teaching transportation-related courses in Central and South America. In particular UTEP has very close relationships with a number of institutions in Mexico and has attracted Mexican students to pursue their post-graduate degrees at UTEP under scholarships from the Mexican Government.<br/><br/>
                The transportation faculty are participating in the teaching of courses and supervising theses in the Transatlantic Dual Masters Degree Program in partnership with Czech Technical University in Czech Republic and University of Zilina in the Slovak Republic.
